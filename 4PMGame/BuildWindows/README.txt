Backstory:

You're a cybernetic dog in a pod being hurled through space towards the planet Mars. 
You were programmed by humans to be like a dog; good boy who's obedient to its owners 
with an immense love for humans. You're on a mission to see if Mars is habitable for mankind. 
As you're hurling through space you see a fleet of evil space cats led by the ancient egyptian 
cat god who is waiting for you at the end of the fleet. You don't fear the fleet for you 
have something hidden up your sleeve. Your space pod is equipped with a state of the art

from it. With this secret weapon in hand, you plunge your way towards the fleet ready to 
destroy them in order to get to the planet mars.
