        You're a cybernetic dog in a pod being hurled through space towards the planet Mars.
      </br>
        You were programmed by humans to be like a dog; 
      </br>
        good boy who's obedient to its owners with an immense love for humans. 
      </br>
        You're on a mission to see if Mars is habitable for mankind. 
      </br>
        As you're hurling through space you see a fleet of evil space cats led by a
      </br>
        cat god who is waiting for you at the end of the fleet. 
      </br>
        You don't fear the fleet for you have something hidden up your sleeve.
      </br>
        Your space pod is equipped with a state of the art magnet that 
      </br>
        produces it's own gravity field and can attract/repel any material towards/away from it.
      </br>
        With this secret weapon in hand, you plunge your way towards the fleet ready to 
      </br>
        destroy them in order to get to the planet mars.
      </br>
      </br>
