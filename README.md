Backstory:

You're a cybernetic dog in a pod being hurled through space towards the planet Mars. 
You were programmed by humans to be like a dog; good boy who's obedient to its owners with an immense love for humans. 
You're on a mission to see if Mars is habitable for mankind.
As you're hurling through space you see a fleet of evil space cats led by the ancient egyptian cat god who is waiting for you at the end of the fleet. 
You don't fear the fleet for you have something hidden up your sleeve.
Your space pod is equipped with a state of the art magnet that produces it's own gravity field and can attract/repel any material towards/away from it. 
With this secret weapon in hand, you plunge your way towards the fleet ready to destroy them in order to get to the planet mars.
